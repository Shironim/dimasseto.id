# Welcam Bro

I'm a fresh graduate in Informatics Engineering, I am particularly interested in Web Technology. I am enthusiastic to explore the application of technology to real-world challenges. I can work with a team and am willing to provide or get different perspectives for work improvement. I always want to try something new to help me get added value for myself or others. Now I am still focusing on learning javascript programming language and its implementation for frontend and backend, currently I am learning more frontend technologies such as Vue.js and Nuxt.js and always want to learn more. I am looking for opportunities to collaborate with passionate professionals and continue to develop my expertise in this field.
